        <p>
        It's the laying in of the action or form. Typical situations involve an artist drawing a series of poses taken by a model in a short amount of time, from little as 30 seconds, or as long as 10 minutes. Gesture drawing is often performed as a warm-up for a life drawing session.

        <p>
        The primary purpose of gesture drawing is to facilitate the study of the human figure in motion. This exploration of action is helpful for the artist to better understand the exertions of muscles, the effects of twisting on the body, and the natural range of motion in the joints.

        <p>
        Drawings longer than two minutes are usually not considered gestures, as they inevitability allow the artist more time to measure and plan the drawing, or to begin to define the form with modeling. Once the artist begins measuring, erasing, or otherwise improving the drawing, they have ceased to gesture draw and begun rendering. They will be improving the complexity of their current drawing, but they are no longer practicing their ability to draw correctly from an instant impression.
